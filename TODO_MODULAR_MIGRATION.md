# TODO: Complete Modular Architecture Migration

## Issue
The v2.7.2 release notes mention a new modular architecture, but the actual entry point (`tellet-admin-tool.js`) is still using the old monolithic code. The new modular code exists in the `lib/` directory but is not being used.

## What was created
- `lib/api.js` - API client with retry and rate limiting
- `lib/auth.js` - Secure authentication module  
- `lib/cache.js` - Caching implementation
- `lib/cli.js` - New CLI setup
- `lib/errors.js` - Error handling
- `lib/logger.js` - Logging utilities
- `lib/validation.js` - Input validation
- `lib/commands/` - Modular command handlers
- `lib/utils/` - Utility modules

## What needs to be done
1. Migrate all commands from `tellet-admin-tool.js` to use the new modular structure
2. Update `tellet-admin-tool.js` to be a simple entry point that calls `lib/cli.js`
3. Test all commands to ensure they work with the new architecture
4. Update tests to match the new structure

## Why this matters
- Users are not getting the security benefits of the new auth module (passwords still accepted as CLI args)
- No retry logic or rate limiting is active
- The caching system is not being used
- The modular structure benefits are not realized

## Temporary solution
The old `tellet-admin-tool-new.js` file has been removed to avoid confusion. The current release still works with the old monolithic code, but doesn't have the advertised features.
